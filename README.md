# AI-Powered Financial Chatbot
Project: BCG GenAI Job Simulation on Forage


# Overview
This project is part of a job simulation experience hosted by BCG (Boston Consulting Group) on the Forage platform. It showcases the development of an AI-driven financial chatbot that interprets company data from SEC filings (10-K/10-Q) to provide structured financial insights.

The chatbot is built using Python and is designed to simulate how AI can be applied to automate financial consulting tasks.

ðŸ§  What the Chatbot Can Do
The chatbot is rule-based and can answer predefined financial queries for Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple from FY 2021 to 2023, such as:

 What is the total revenue?

 What is the Net Income?

 What is the sum of total assets/liabilities?

 What is the revenue/net income/assets/liabilities growth (%)?

 What is the year-over-year average growth rate for key metrics?

# Technologies Used
Python 3.8+

pandas â€“ for data manipulation

Jupyter Notebook â€“ for prototyping logic

CLI â€“ Command-line interaction with the chatbot

# Files Included
File	Description
chatbot.py	Core logic of the rule-based chatbot
task1.ipynb / task1-checkpoint.ipynb	Notebook with intermediate development
Financial_Data_Microsoft_Tesla_Apple.csv	Raw financial data extracted from 10-K filings
Summary_final_report.csv	Summary of growth metrics
Documentation_ChatBot.txt	Technical and functional documentation of chatbot

# How to Use It
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Run the chatbot script:

python chatbot.py
Follow the prompts:

Choose a company (Apple, Microsoft, Tesla)

Choose a fiscal year (2021â€“2023)

# Key Learnings
Applied Python programming to real-world financial data

Built a functional AI chatbot using rule-based logic

Understood financial metrics from SEC filings (10-K/10-Q)

Practiced delivering insights in a user-friendly conversational format

# Limitations
 Only understands exact, predefined queries
 No NLP or fuzzy matching capabilities
 Data is static (not real-time or dynamic)

# Future Improvements
Incorporate NLP techniques for flexible question handling

Connect to live financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, EDGAR)

Develop a web interface using Streamlit or Flask
