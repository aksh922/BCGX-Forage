 Financial Chatbot Prototype Documentation

 Overview

This chatbot prototype is a simplified AI assistant designed to answer basic financial queries based on previously analyzed data from the 10-K filings of  Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple  over the past three fiscal years. The chatbot operates using a simple  if-else logic  in Python, mapping user queries to predefined responses.

Predefined Queries It Can Answer

1.  What is the total revenue? 
2.  What is the Net Income? 
3.  What is the sum of total assets? 
4.  What is the sum of total liabilities? 
5.  What is cash flow from operating activities? 
6.  What is the revenue growth(%)? 
7.  What is the net income growth(%)? 
8.  What is the assets growth(%)? 
9.  What is the liabilities growth(%)? 
10.  What is the cash flow from operations growth(%)? 
11.  What is the year by year average revenue growth rate(%)? 
12.  What is the year by year average net income growth rate(%)? 
13.  What is the year by year average assets growth rate(%)? 
14.  What is the year by year average liabilities growth rate(%)? 
15.  What is the year by year average cash flow from operations growth rate(%)?

 How the Chatbot Works 

* The chatbot receives the user query as a string.
* It matches the query exactly against a set of  predefined strings  using `if-elif` logic.
* If a match is found, it returns the corresponding  canned response  based on actual financial data or calculated metrics.
* If there‚Äôs no match, the chatbot replies with:
  `"Sorry, I can only provide information on predefined queries."`

### üí°  Example Code Logic 

```python
def simple_chatbot(user_query):
    if user_query == "What is the total revenue?":
        return "Total Revenue (3-year sum for all companies): $2.2 trillion"
    elif user_query == "What is the Net Income?":
        return "Combined Net Income: $659.01 billion"
    # ... other predefined responses ...
    else:
        return "Sorry, I can only provide information on predefined queries."
```

Data Sources 

The chatbot's responses are based on financial figures extracted from the  10-K reports  of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple from FY 2021 to FY 2024.

 Limitations 

*  Fixed Queries Only:  It only understands and responds to  exactly predefined  questions.
*  No NLP or AI Understanding:  The chatbot does not understand natural language variations (e.g., ‚ÄúTell me the total revenue‚Äù won‚Äôt work).
*  Static Data:  Responses are based on hardcoded or pre-calculated values, not real-time data.
*  No Dynamic Interaction:  It cannot handle follow-ups or context-based queries.

 Next Steps (For Future Enhancement) 

* Add fuzzy matching or NLP to understand varied phrasing.
* Connect to a backend data source for dynamic answers.
* Upgrade to a web interface using Flask or Streamlit.
